#	Precedence refers to how versions are compared to each other when ordered.
#	Precedence MUST be calculated by separating the version into major, minor,
#	patch and pre-release identifiers in that order (Build metadata does not figure
#	into precedence). Precedence is determined by the first difference when comparing
#	each of these identifiers from left to right as follows: Major, minor, and patch
#	versions are always compared numerically. Example: 1.0.0 < 2.0.0 < 2.1.0 < 2.1.1.
#	When major, minor, and patch are equal, a pre-release version has lower precedence
#	than a normal version. Example: 1.0.0-alpha < 1.0.0. Precedence for two pre-release
#	versions with the same major, minor, and patch version MUST be determined by
#	comparing each dot separated identifier from left to right until a difference is
#	found as follows: identifiers consisting of only digits are compared numerically
#	and identifiers with letters or hyphens are compared lexically in ASCII sort order.
#	Numeric identifiers always have lower precedence than non-numeric identifiers.
#	A larger set of pre-release fields has a higher precedence than a smaller set,
#	if all of the preceding identifiers are equal. Example: 1.0.0-alpha < 1.0.0-alpha.1
#	< 1.0.0-alpha.beta < 1.0.0-beta < 1.0.0-beta.2 < 1.0.0-beta.11 < 1.0.0-rc.1 < 1.0.0.
