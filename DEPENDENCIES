#	This file describes and defines the dependencies used for testing.
#	The file is "included" by 'make' and is mostly used to identify docker images.
#	The syntax is also accepted by the shell and so could be used in other contexts.
#	This should be the single place for specifying dependencies.

#	'bats' is used for functional testing of semver (called "unit-tests")
